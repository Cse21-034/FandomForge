Perfect! That clarifies a lot â€” so you want a multi-creator content platform (like OnlyFans/Patreon), where:

Users can register as creators or consumers.

Creators can upload paid and free content.

Consumers can subscribe to creators for premium access.

Free content is visible to all, paid content requires subscription.

Frontend and backend are fully decoupled â†’ React frontend (deployable on Vercel) and Node.js/Express backend (deployable on Render or similar).
